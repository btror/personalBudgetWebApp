# Personal Budget Management App

A personal budget management web application. Users can create an account for free.

(Heroku only gives half a month of free hosting, so if it doesn't load it's because I don't have any more free dynos)

## Tech stack 

- The frontend was built using the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) library and bootstrap. 

- The backend was built using NodeJS and the server is configured with the express backend framework.

- Mongoose was used to build the database. 

- Used Heroku to host the application.
